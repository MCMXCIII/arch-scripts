## This is the readme for the env scripts these script can be used if you dont want to use the manual enviroment

# What is this please explain
Ill will mamek a nother file explaining this in more detail but for now all you have to know that
this folder contains the scripts needed to install podman and use all of the tools from a podman container instead of downloading all of the tools from the AUR/APT package manager.

## Pleas make sure that when you run this you make another ssh-key to use with podman as the rest of the script will fail without the presencse of a ssh key you can generate an ssh key using the following 

"ssh-keygen"

I reccomend using a keys with 4026b size
